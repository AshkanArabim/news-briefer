# Newsbridge
(Note: This app is still under active development. Expect serious bugs.)

Are you a fan of daily news briefings, but wish you had a wider selection of
sources? Say no more! Newsbridge is a simple app that allows you to add your
sources as RSS feeds, and then delivers the top stories rom all sources 
(**regardless of the source language**) on demand as a 5-6 minute audio 
briefing.

## Contributing
Please open a pull request first, then ask to be assigned to it. We don't want
to be stepping on each other's toes while the project is under heavy 
development.

These rules will become more comprehensive as the project grows.
