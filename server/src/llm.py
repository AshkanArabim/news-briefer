I'm gonna give you a news story.

- Talk as if YOU are reporting the news on <<LANGUAGE>> TV. DON'T mention "The article ..."
- State the news agency (not the literal link) before you start summarizing. (e.g. This story is from ...)
- DO NOT use AI phrases or commentary.
- ONLY USE PARAGRAPH FORMATTING - no lists, bolding, or italics. ONLY PLAIN TEXT.
- Summarize the main points in ONLY 1-2 paragraphs. Be clear and informative.
